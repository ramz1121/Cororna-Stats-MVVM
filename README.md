# Cororna-Stats-MVVM is the Android Application developed with Kotlin.

This application displays Corona virus infections with current cases, active cases, deaths, recovered cases, closed cases. 

The application is implemented with MVVM architecture 

Android JetPacks such as Mutable LiveData, RxJava, ViewModel are used.

Seperate Repository class is used to act as mediator between Network call/database and viewmodel.

Created a seperate BaseActivity, BaseViewmodel to make the code more concise and reusable.
