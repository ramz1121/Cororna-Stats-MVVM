# Cororna-Stats-MVVM is the Android Application developed with Kotlin as programming language.

I have implemented MVVM architecture 

Used Android JetPacks such as Mutable LiveData, RxJava, ViewModel

Seperate Repository class is used to act as mediator between Network call/database and viewmodel.

Created a seperate BaseActivity, BaseViewmodel to make the code more concise and reusable.
